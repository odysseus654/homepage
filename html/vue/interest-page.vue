                <p>
                    With my recent time in Uru I discovered Second Life, which promised to be a place where I could create my own worlds, to explore and experience
                    the creativity of others.  And it kinda was, more in the beginning though.  I treasured finding places like an island full of AI-powered evolutionary
                    creatures, of four-dimensional houses where (if you don't look too closely) you could find yourself going through the wrong series of doors and find yourself
                    walking on the ceiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the world started aging over time and a lot of it came down to money.  At the beginning the company running the grid wanted to have as much
                    creativity blooming as possible so they would sponsor new user welcoming committees, and land fees would be waived if you were a "university" educating
                    "residents" on how to create things or had something creatively significant.  However these got shut down one-by-one, land prices kept going up, and
                    those with creative builds struggled to pay the monthly bill and not have their work get summarily deleted.  If you were "renting" from someone else
                    (i.e. not paying Second Life directly for the land) then you could find your creations deleted unexpectedly through something going wrong with the middleman
                    (the lack of contract law felt very problematic to me, especially it prevented a group from being collectively financially responsible).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the people behind the company as well as its intent changed over time.  When I came on the people running the company were visionaries trying
                    (and succeeding) to create something new.  There was a fair amount of work done on making Second Life not only a virtual world they controlled but
                    also one that <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Open_Grid_Public_Beta" target="_blank">could federate to become a distributed group of worlds</a>.
                    Over time the people working on this were pushed out and replaced by investors that seemed to be more interested in getting as much value out of this
                    surprising success as they could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, most places either died and were abandoned or were converted into malls and dance areas (the only ways people could make enough money
                    to still exist).  Most land that was bought directly from the company (except for the dedicated islands) ended up being abandoned and empty; the
                    mechanism where unowned land is resold seems to have ground to an effective halt.  This cut off most ability for communal areas rather than
                    walled gardens. A few special places were chosen to be "bought" by the company running the world, the island with the AI birds is still there
                    but all the animals on it died long ago; no one visits anymore, there's no reason to.
