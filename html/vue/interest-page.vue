                <p>
                    I had been curious about amateur radio for a number of years (there was someone with a radio that would go to a science-fiction
                    group I was a part of) but for a long time I didn't really know how to "get into" the program.  Eventually I found a group and
                    figured out how to get my license.  I was easily known in the group for my computer knowledge, and while much of that did crossover
                    into knowing how radios work a lot of it didn't; I remember being frustrated trying to figure out what a "power supply" was,
                    the closest answer I got was instructions from one person on how to build one from a microwave oven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I quickly realized that once I had a license, the best way to actually make use of it was to join an ECOMM (Emergency Communications)
                    group.  These groups consisted of amateur radio operators working with the local police, sheriff, Red Cross, or other agency
                    to both provide communication during events and train for helping out in disasters.  I did help out a number of years with
                    <a href="https://skitosea.com/" target="_blank">SkiToSea</a>, in a number of races, and events that required coordination of cars
                    and people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time I got increasingly interested in the <a href="https://openhpsdr.org/" target="_blank">HPSDR</a> project, where
                    a radio could be built that grabs a huge chunk of the radio spectrum and permits a swath of it to be interpreted and understood
                    by software.  The ability to take a frequency block and take it apart and see how it ticks, the ability to put a radio together
                    inside a computer by dragging the equivalent of a flowchart together, was very appealing to me.  I did end up getting the parts
                    for a basic SDR capable of receiving all frequencies below 65 MHz (and some of the pieces required to transmit) and worked to
                    get a relatively "mobile" setup running with my netbook at the time.  I'm thinking in retrospective that my biggest limitation
                    was the lack of knowledge of how radios (and avoiding interference) works, and also a lack of time to dedicate to working on the
                    project.

                <p>
                    With my recent time in Uru I discovered Second Life, which promised to be a place where I could create my own worlds, to explore and experience
                    the creativity of others.  And it kinda was, more in the beginning though.  I treasured finding places like an island full of AI-powered evolutionary
                    creatures, of four-dimensional houses where (if you don't look too closely) you could find yourself going through the wrong series of doors and find yourself
                    walking on the ceiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the world started aging over time and a lot of it came down to money.  At the beginning the company running the grid wanted to have as much
                    creativity blooming as possible so they would sponsor new user welcoming committees, and land fees would be waived if you were a "university" educating
                    "residents" on how to create things or had something creatively significant.  However these got shut down one-by-one, land prices kept going up, and
                    those with creative builds struggled to pay the monthly bill and not have their work get summarily deleted.  If you were "renting" from someone else
                    (i.e. not paying Second Life directly for the land) then you could find your creations deleted unexpectedly through something going wrong with the middleman
                    (the lack of contract law felt very problematic to me, especially it prevented a group from being collectively financially responsible).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the people behind the company as well as its intent changed over time.  When I came on the people running the company were visionaries trying
                    (and succeeding) to create something new.  There was a fair amount of work done on making Second Life not only a virtual world they controlled but
                    also one that <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Open_Grid_Public_Beta" target="_blank">could federate to become a distributed group of worlds</a>.
                    Over time the people working on this were pushed out and replaced by investors that seemed to be more interested in getting as much value out of this
                    surprising success as they could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, most places either died and were abandoned or were converted into malls and dance areas (the only ways people could make enough money
                    to still exist).  Most land that was bought directly from the company (except for the dedicated islands) ended up being abandoned and empty; the
                    mechanism where unowned land is resold seems to have ground to an effective halt.  This cut off most ability for communal areas rather than
                    walled gardens. A few special places were chosen to be "bought" by the company running the world, the island with the AI birds is still there
                    but all the animals on it died long ago; no one visits anymore, there's no reason to.

                    I don't have strong knowledge of when I started focusing on Cyan, I know I played their game 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst" target="_blank">Myst</a> early in school and was very much into a similar (but less well-known)
                    later game named <a href="http://obsidian.internetwhiteknight.com/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. When Myst's sequel
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riven" target="_blank">Riven</a> came out I started participating more on message boards with 
                    other players, exploring the world they built and the philosophical questions it raised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Cyan started putting together <a href="https://archive.guildofarchivists.org/wiki/Uru:_Ages_Beyond_Myst" target="_blank">an MMORPG based on Myst</a>
                    (and renamed themselves <a href="https://youtu.be/ob2Unym9nUQ" target="_blank">"Cyan Worlds"</a>), I was excited and my online involvement
                    led to my being invited to both the closed alpha and beta for the game.  Unfortunately the publisher Cyan was working with shut the servers
                    down before the product released due to a lack of enough interest in the game and it was eventually released as a standalone game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did play the standalone game (and the puzzles I tested previously, now modified to work for a single player) and also hung around in "the Cavern"
                    on multiplayer servers where they could be found (either ran by the publisher or directly by Cyan, I don't remember but more likely the latter).
                    I was likely somewhat disillusioned by the failure and stagnation of the project and lured away to Second Life about this point with its promise
                    of allowing me to create my own <a href="https://dni.fandom.com/wiki/Age" target="_blank">"Ages"</a>.
